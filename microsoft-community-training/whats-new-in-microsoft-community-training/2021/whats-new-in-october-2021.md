# Whatâ€™s new in October 2021

As the world moves towards the last quarter of the year 2021, the fight against the pandemic has gained momentum with vaccination drives being conducted around the world. In line with this, the  Community Training Team has worked its way through this phase to make the platform a better place to manage and learn.

We are excited to share the new  Community Training product update with you. Here are some key features introduced in this release that are designed to help you continue to manage and deliver online learning seamlessly to your community.

## Multiple authentication modes in a single instance

Many organizations might want to support multiple authentication options to be available for their learners. The platform now supports adding more than one Authentication option for a single CT instance.

For instance, you can now enable CT phone authentication alongside your existing social login on the ADB2C tenant. Users can choose to register and sign in either via phone or their social email.

## Learner certificates on completion of Learning paths

Administrators now choose to enable customized certificates after the successful completion of the Learning path by learners.

## Blended learning with Microsoft Teams

 Community Training platform allows the Administrators to set up and schedule meetings with Microsoft Teams from within the platform itself without needing to switch between platforms. Administrators can create meetings for groups of learners enrolled in a specific course, learning path, or user group to enhance the learning curve.

## Edit smart group rules

With this new release,  Community Training allows administrators to [edit the rules of existing smart groups](../../user-management/organize-users/setup-automatic-user-enrollment-for-a-group-1.md#case-2-group-already-has-rules-applied-edit-smart-group-rules) on the platform. The users who satisfy the new rule definitions will automatically get added to the smart group and content will be assigned to them basis the assignment in the Group.

In our efforts to make the platform more inclusive, we now also support the localization of the administrator portal by allowing the administrators to choose one of the languages enabled by the Global Administrator after switching to the administrator portal.

## Launch of progressive web application

In this release, the platform is launching [support for progressive web applications](../../infrastructure-management/install-your-platform-instance/create-publish-mobile-app.md#option-1-creating-a-progressive-web-application-pwa-for-android) (PWA), to make the web application installable as a mobile application for hosting on application stores. In this release, the PWA-based application will be available only for the Android eco-system and will not support content download for consumption in no-connectivity mode. In the next release, planned for December 2021 the progressive web application support will be extended to the iOS eco-system and content download. The platform will then plan to deprecate the current process of generating mobile application AAB files via support tickets.
